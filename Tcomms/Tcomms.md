## Abstract
The removal of groundside radio favorises reliance on RTOs, thus giving them a greater use since after techwebs removal they have languished. This means that marines want to stay closer to RTOs, increasing groundside squad cohesion, and gives a soft way of increasing the chances of riflemen following CIC's orders, as even though they don't have to, RTOs do, and they stick close to RTOs. It also discourages the "solo fragger" complex.
<!-- An abstract is a short blurb, about a paragraph or two, succinctly describing your feature. This should mostly be "why", but can include "what". -->

## Goals
1. Increase cohesion on the squad level
2. Give a purpose to RTOs
3. Makes riflemen more likely to follow orders in a way that doesn't require OOC enforcement. 
<!-- This is a numbered list clearly detailing your goals for the feature. As per usual, this should be a mixture of both why and what. -->

## Non-goals
1. Stop marines from communicating with CIC at all. Not the case, as APC, DS, RTOs, and some spots on some maps have phones. (For example shivas has some)
2. Force RTOs to spend there entire time relaying orders.
3. Make marines act as one big blob at all times to avoid ever being far away from an RTO.
<!-- Just like goals, but the opposite! Every feature has boundaries it won't step over. These should be written as if they start with "We will not...". -->

## Content
Removes tcomms, so that the way to communicate inbetween shipside and groundside is phones.
Allows CIC's headsets and the more advanced factions ERT's headsets to still function groundside however. 
<!-- Now's where you get into clear detail about everything your feature does. **You should still be explaining 'why' things are that way, *as* you describe what.** Be as detailed as possible. -->

## Alternatives
Static Tcomms, which I didn't choose because it's the same effect as normal tcomms, except requiring marines to defend it, and a small use of metal/plasteel/sandbags etc.
Making headsets work in radius around RTOs, which I didn't choose because of the performance issues that would be near inevitable. 
Allow tcomms to be acquired, but in a more complex way then getting it roundstart, via IOs when they are readded for example. not chosen because of the fact IOs haven't been readded. yet. 
<!-- Provide potential alternatives to your feature, either ones that align with your design values, or ones that don't that you suspect will be suggested. If you are including the latter, make sure to explain why you didn't choose that. -->

## Potential Changes
Allow SLs to communicate via radio with their headsets.
Make engis able to build phones, so that communication lines can be set up at "Secondary FOBs" (Hydro on LV, Bar on SR)
<!-- Most of the time you're not going to get the best design first try. It helps to try your best to predict what *could* go wrong, and suggest alternatives that can be taken, without sacrificing your design. -->
