## Abstract

War Correspondent is a journalist role, meant to be a sort've independent/marine aligned CL. It's meant to provide more roleplay opportunities and add more flavour to the game I guess.

## Goals

1. Create a role that's interesting and provides new oppirtunities along with spicing up the game I suppose
2. Create a roleplay-centric role that's differentiated from the CL enough to be its own thing

## Non-goals

1. Making another CL
2. Shifting the balance of the game
3. Giving new opportunities for grief

## Content

(To be added) When WC players spawn in they get a choice from either Marine or Independent which sets them on their alignment for the round, they get a whole new office, vendor, and new clothes. A new fancy camera also spawns in there that can take more photos then other cameras. Also with this MR I've changed camera code a bit to include the amount of photos left whenever you examine a camera.

## Alternatives

Any role that can fill the niche of being a CL who isn't aligned with WY, whether they be independent or directly aligned against W-Y. Didn't go for that 100% because of requested changes

## Potential Changes

Add more stuff to the Journalists camera, possibly give them some other unique features.
