## Abstract

War Correspondent is a journalist role, able to pick at the beginning of the round whether it's marine aligned or independent (The only difference being one can take orders from an XO and gets a rank, with the other not having a military rank). It's meant to provide more roleplay opportunities and add more flavour. It provides more opportunities because it's contextually different from CL who is usually maligned by Marine players, with this role it'll be completely different as WC starts with 0 W-Y affiliation and probably won't get such derision, along with just being a contextually different role with different objectives than the CL. 

## Goals

1. Create a role that's interesting and provides new oppirtunities along with spicing up the game, the WC is contextually different from any other role in the game, providing leeway for players to get creative with the way they play their character in this role.
2. Create a roleplay-centric role that's differentiated from the CL enough to be its own thing

## Non-goals

1. Making another CL, the CL has a specific role as the W-Y guy. This role should not just be just that, it's contextually different and provides players a choice with who they align with.
2. Shifting the balance of the game, WC has no impact on the general balance of the game, and shouldn't. It gets the same gear as a PFC would.
3. Giving new opportunities for grief

## Content

Roleplay role similar to CL but gets their own vendor and armor for deployment, similar to PFC in that way but is contextually different and not provided enough to be a complete match for PFC, leading to more roleplay and less PFC'ing. I expect people to get creative like with CL and try to make entertaining roleplay scenarios, whether it be interviewing people or getting together group photos.

## Alternatives

It cant be forced into a marine alignment as that would defeat the entire point of the role being created and instantly put them at odds with the CL who usually goes against the marines in some fashion (faxes, etc). It also can't be W-Y aligned because that would just make it CL 2.0. There have been suggestions to not give them guns/ammo but making the role defenseless serves no purpose other than potential "realism" which isn't necessary.
