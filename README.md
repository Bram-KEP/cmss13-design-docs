## Meet the Team

### Head Developer and Project Manager

The Head Developer and Project Manager are responsible for controlling, adding, and removing gameplay architects from the project. In addition to filling the role of a normal gameplay architect, they have sole authority on who becomes a gameplay architect, as well as who remains a gameplay architect and who does not.

### Gameplay Architects

Gameplay architects are design control. If a proposed document does not fit with the game, they can request you to change it, or simply just close the pull request. Gameplay architects are required to give a reason for closing the pull request.

Gameplay architects can revert your changes if they feel they are not worth implementing or if they did not live up to the expected results.

<details>
<summary>Gameplay Architect Guidelines</summary>

These are the few directives we have for gameplay architects.

- Do not merge PRs you create.
- Do not merge PRs until 24 hours have passed since it was opened. Give enough time for others to look over it.
- Do not merge PRs that contain content from the [banned content list](#banned-content).

These are not steadfast rules as gameplay architects are expected to use their best judgement when operating.

Our team is entirely voluntary, as such we extend our thanks to the developers and contributors alike for helping keep the project alive.
